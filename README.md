# Python Base

This course is the first step in starting your career in development. It is designed for individuals who have never had any prior experience with programming or for those who already have some knowledge of other languages but need to learn Python.

We’ll begin with the foundational theory of programming, setting up and configuring your development environment, selecting a code editor, and writing your first script. The course progresses through creating various small programs covering Python’s key functionalities and culminates in developing a complete project from scratch, following the best practices in the industry.

**Estimated Duration**: 64 hours
